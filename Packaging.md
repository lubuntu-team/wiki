This is the Lubuntu Packaging guide. It is a **work in progress**, but it aims to be a complete knowledgebase for everything packaging-related, for anyone from the person that's completely new to packaging all the way to the experienced packager needing a reference.

This packaging guide, while it aims to be self-contained, is not meant to override [Debian Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/) and related documents, but rather to clarify them. As a wise developer once said:
> Policy is your friend. Trust the Policy. Love the Policy. Obey the Policy.
